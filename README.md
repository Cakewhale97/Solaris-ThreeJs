# Solaris ThreeJs

1. **Lighting Effects**: Experiment with different lighting types like point lights, spotlights, and ambient lights. Try to simulate sunlight and see how it affects the appearance of your planets.

2. **Orbits**: Create orbit paths for the planets. You could use `THREE.Line` or `THREE.LineLoop` with `THREE.CircleGeometry` to visualize the orbits.

3. **Interactive Camera Controls**: Implement camera controls to allow users to navigate through your scene. `OrbitControls` is a popular choice for this.

4. **Animations**: Besides rotating the planets, consider other animations. For example, you could simulate the orbital movement of planets around the sun.

5. **Advanced Textures and Materials**: Explore bump maps, specular maps, and normal maps to give more realistic surface details to your planets.

6. **Physics Simulations**: If you're up for a challenge, you could integrate a physics engine or write basic physics simulations to mimic gravitational forces.

7. **User Interface**: Add an interactive UI that allows users to click buttons to navigate or learn more about each planet.

8. **Background Music or Sound Effects**: Incorporate background music or sound effects to enhance the immersive experience.

9. **Responsive Design**: Make your project responsive to different screen sizes and devices.

10. **Loading Screens**: Implement loading screens or progress bars for when textures and models are loading.

These ideas can significantly enhance your project's interactivity and visual appeal, offering a great opportunity to learn more advanced aspects of Three.js and WebGL.
